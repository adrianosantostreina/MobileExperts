# Mobile Experts
Mobile Experts is an OpenSource plugin for installation in Delphi that implements features that facilitate Mobile iOS and Android development.

This is version 1.0 Beta and we are at the beginning. Soon we will bring more news.

If you are a Delphi developer and would like to contribute to the project, send us your Pull Request.

We also welcome suggestions and comments about the Expert in the <b>Issues section</b>.

## Installation
Installing Mobile Experts is very simple by following the steps below:

<ul>
  <li>1. Download the source code via the Code > Download Zip button on GitHub or use your favorite GIT client.</li>
  <li>2. Open your Delphi version and then the MobileExperts.dpk package.</li>
  <li>3. Make a Build and then Install to install in Delphi.</li>
</ul>

A new Mobile Experts menu will appear in Delphi.

## Use
Mobile Experts should implement many features. In this 1.0 Beta version, we implemented a single functionality: automatic icon creation for your Android/iOS app.

Usage is simple.

   <li>1. Open your Firemonkey project.</li>
   <li>2. Right-click on the project name in Project Manager.</li>
   <li>3. Locate and click on the <b>"Create Icons for this Application..."</b> option in my context*.</li>
</ul>

*...or select the Mobile Experts menu in Delphi right after the Help menu.

A dialog box will open.</br>

You can set application icons as well as Splash images by clicking the corresponding buttons.

Click on <b>Generate Files</b>.
The utility will create all icon sizes based on the icon or image selected in <b>Icon Image</b> and/or <b>Launch Image</b>.

This process will just create the icons in your project folder.
If you want to automatically add to .dproj, just click on the <b>Update Project</b> button.

A copy of the .dproj will be created by selecting the <b>Create backup before apply (.dproj)</b> checkbox.
